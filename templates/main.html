    {% if view == "age" %}
        <h2>Average Age</h2>
        <p>The average age in the dataset is: {{ avg_age }}</p>
        <h2>Fun fact</h2>
        <p>The median age in the U.S. is around 38 years old, which means half of Americans are older than 38, and half are younger. But here's the kicker: if you think you're "middle-aged" at 38, remember‚Äîyou might actually be just getting started! In 1900, the average life expectancy in the U.S. was just 47 years. So, congratulations to today's 38-year-olds, who are living in a time where they‚Äôre still considered "young" compared to their great-grandparents!
            Also, if you're in your 40s or 50s, it‚Äôs a great time to claim you're "still a kid" in the grand scheme of things!</p>
    {% elif view == "gender" %}
        <h2>Gender Distribution</h2>
        <p>Male: {{ male }} | Female: {{ female }}</p>
        <h2>Fun fact</h2>
        <p>Did you know that there are slightly more women than men in the U.S.? In fact, women make up about 51% of the population, while men make up about 49%. So, if you're ever feeling outnumbered in a group of people, just remember: statistically speaking, the ladies are winning‚Äîjust by a little bit!
            It‚Äôs almost like the universe's way of making sure that every "man cave" has at least one "woman‚Äôs touch" to balance it out!</p>
    {% elif view == "bmi" %}
        <h2>Average BMI</h2>
        <p>The average BMI in the dataset is: {{ avg_bmi }}</p>
        <h2>Fun fact</h2>
        <p>The average BMI in the U.S. is 29.0, which puts the average American in the "overweight" category. So technically, if you're feeling a bit round, you're just ‚Äúon trend‚Äù! In fact, the average BMI could probably start its own fitness program called ‚ÄúThe Couch Potato Challenge‚Äù‚Äîit encourages a little bit of snacking, a little bit of napping, and a lot of being just a smidge heavier than ideal. You know, for "health" reasons.</p>
    {% elif view == "children" %}
        <h2>Average Number of Children</h2>
        <p>The average number of children in the dataset is: {{ avg_children }}</p>
        <h2>Fun fact</h2>
        <p>The average number of children per family in the U.S. is about 1.9. So technically, the "average family" has just shy of two kids, which means there‚Äôs always that one parent who‚Äôs like, "We almost had a full set!" It's like a family version of "the sequel that never quite happened." Also, if you're one of the lucky ones with just one child, you're officially a "family of almost two"‚Äîbut hey, you‚Äôve got a built-in excuse for not needing to buy a second set of everything!</p>
    {% elif view == "smoker" %}
        <h2>Smoker vs Non-Smoker</h2>
        <p>Smokers: {{ smoker }} | Non-Smokers: {{ non_smoker }}</p>
        <h2>Good to know</h2>
        <p>In the United States, the percentage of adults who smoke has significantly declined over the decades. As of 2020, only about 12.5% of adults were current smokers, compared to 42% in 1965. That means nearly 87.5% of adults in the U.S. are now non-smokers, a stark contrast to the smoking culture of past decades!
            This change is largely attributed to public health campaigns, increased awareness of the risks of smoking, and the rising popularity of smoke-free alternatives. Interestingly, studies have shown that non-smokers not only live longer but also save an average of $2,292 annually by not buying cigarettes‚Äîa strong motivation for many to quit!</p>
    {% elif view == "region" %}
        <h2>Region Analysis</h2>
        <p>Currently, the people per region in our study are balanced</p>
        <ul>
            {% for region, count in region_counts.items() %}
                <li>{{ region }}: {{ count }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% elif view == "charges" %}
        <h2>Fun fact</h2>
        <p>The average annual health insurance premium for a single person in 2023 was approximately $7,911, while for families it soared to $22,463. That's roughly the cost of buying a brand-new small car every year‚Äîor a lifetime supply of donuts (about 150,000 donuts)! üç©
            It‚Äôs no surprise many people feel like health insurance costs take a big bite out of their wallets!</p>
        <h2>Average Charges</h2>
        <p>The average charges in the dataset are: ${{ avg_charge }}</p>
    {% elif view == "compare" %}

        <h2>Comparison Results</h2>
        {% if comparison_data %}
