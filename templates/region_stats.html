        <h2>Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
        <h3>Northwest</h3>
        <p>The Northwest region, including Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, has a high focus on preventive care and wellness. Many residents benefit from employer-provided insurance, and the region sees lower-than-average uninsured rates due to robust Medicaid expansion efforts.</p>

        <h3>Northeast</h3>
        <p>The Northeast, with states like New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, has some of the most comprehensive healthcare systems. The region is known for high insurance premiums but offers extensive coverage options. Massachusetts was a pioneer in healthcare reform, leading to low uninsured rates.</p>

        <h3>Southwest</h3>
        <p>In the Southwest, states like Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas face challenges with higher uninsured rates, especially in rural areas. Medicaid expansion has helped many, but the region still struggles with affordability and access in certain communities.</p>

        <h3>Southeast</h3>
        <p>The Southeast, including Florida, Georgia, and the Carolina's, has some of the highest uninsured rates in the country. Economic disparities and limited Medicaid expansion have contributed to this issue. However, insurance marketplaces have provided vital coverage to many residents.</p>
